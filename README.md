Hello, this is Robert (Bobby) Hemming.

There are some instructions that print to the console, but I thought I would add some notes here too.

The main solutions to the interview questions are in assignment.py

The script requires Python 3.10 and libraries matplotlib and plotly.

After that it should just be a case of running the script and the solutions to each question should be separated out clearly enough.

Please feel free to contact me if there are any problems.

Thanks

Bobby
